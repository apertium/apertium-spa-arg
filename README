**************Spanish--Aragonese******************

You need apertium-3.0 and lttoolbox-3.0 to use this translator.  To compile
the linguistic data simply do:

./configure
make
make install

inside of this directory.

To use the translator, use the commands:

apertium es-an  (to translate from Spanish to Aragonese)

Type the suitable command in the terminal, press Enter, type the text and press Ctrl+D to get the translation.

**************TAGGER *****************************

To use this language-pair package with apertium YOU DO NOT NEED TO
RETRAIN THE TAGGER. Probabilities and auxiliary data are provided for
both the ca-es and the es-ca translation directions which should be
acceptable for most applications, and should work even if you change
the dictionaries in a reasonably way.

If for some reason you need to retrain the tagger (for example, you
have made really extensive changes to the dictionaries such as
creating new lexical categories), please see the documentation
on our Wiki:
