* Release 0.3
* Improvements since version 0.2:
   * Improved tagger (PoS desambiguator) for Aragonese. Changes in the tagger
   rules (...an.tsx) and unsupervised training in the Wikipedia corpus. 
   * Improvement in coverage and morphology of Aragonese monolingual dictionary.
     > 546 paradigms, 
     > 21073 lemmae (of which, 8047 proper nouns), including 1921 multi-words. 
     ~568 000 different analyzable surface forms, 
     ~117 500 different generated surface forms. 
     Naïve coverage: from 88.4% in an.wikipedia to 94.0% in a corpus of narrative texts.
   * Some paradigms fixed (e.g. seguir)
   * Some rules fixed (e.g. prep+el+que --> prep+o+que)
   * Some rules added (véase --> se veiga, léaselo --> se lo leiga, behaviour of
   buen, mal before a noun)
   * Improved distinction beteen a<pr> and a<det> (a2) and two meanings of "ta" so
   that the postgenerator can apply different rules to them.
   * Use of apocopated posesives mi, tu, su is dealt with in analysis.
   * Periphrastic past dealt with in analysis (synthetic forms are used for
   generation, although rules for using periphrastic instead are written and
   commented).
* Main pending Issues:
   * Still room to improve on coverage.
   * Still much to work on transfer.

* Release 0.2
* First operative bidirectional release.
* Improvements:
   * Aragonese monodix and bidix in the initial release (0.1.0) were checked 
     and corrected.
   * Huge improvement in the completeness of verbal and nominal morphology. 
     Wide paradigms analysing most dialectal forms and orthographic variations 
     (see Note on orthography below).
   * Closed classes completed.
   * Treatment of enclitics (up to combinations of two enclitics), including 
     dialectal non-standard combinations.
   * Treatment of apostrophation (analysis and (post)-generation).
   * Orthographic variation concentrated on monodix.
   * Dialectal variation concentrated (when possible) on monodix.
   * Possesives fixed.
   * Impersonal haber-ie dealt with.
   * Important increase in the dictionary size and coverage. 
     > 510 paradigms, 
     > 17500 lemmae (of which, 8025 proper nouns), including 1786 multi-words. 
     ~500 000 analyzable surface forms, 
     ~120 000 generated surface forms. 
     86.3% naïve coverage in wikipedia.
   * es monodix trimmed to bidix using ignore label (i="yes").
* Main pending Issues:
   * Still room to improve on coverage.
   * Still much to work on transfer (current version based on a reduced and 
     tuned subset of rules from es-ca).
   * Current POS disambiguator is directly taken from es-ca.
     Note: Orthography is taken from "Academia de l'Aragonés - Estudio de 
     Filolochía Aragonesa", a board created in the II Congreso de l'Aragonés.  
     http://www.academiadelaragones.org/biblio/EDACAR7_2.pdf . 
     It is the orthography used in Wikipedia in Aragonese 
     (http://an.wikipedia.org). 
     There is  partial compatibility in analysis with other previously used 
     orthographies.
