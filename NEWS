* Release 0.2.0
* First operative bidirectional release.
* Improvements:
   * Aragonese monodix and bidix in the initial release (0.1.0) were checked 
     and corrected.
   * Huge improvement in the completeness of verbal and nominal morphology. 
     Wide paradigms analysing most dialectal forms and orthographic variations 
     (see Note on orthography below).
   * Closed classes completed.
   * Treatment of enclitics (up to combinations of two enclitics), including 
     dialectal non-standard combinations.
   * Treatment of apostrophation (analysis and (post)-generation).
   * Orthographic variation concentrated on monodix.
   * Dialectal variation concentrated (when possible) on monodix.
   * Possesives fixed.
   * Impersonal haber-ie dealt with.
   * Important increase in the dictionary size and coverage. 
     > 510 paradigms, 
     > 17500 lemmae (of which, 8025 proper nouns), including 1786 multi-words. 
     ~500 000 analyzable surface forms, 
     ~120 000 generated surface forms. 
     86.3% naïve coverage in wikipedia.
   * es monodix trimmed to bidix using ignore label (i="yes").
* Main pending Issues:
   * Still room to improve on coverage.
   * Still much to work on transfer (current version based on a reduced and 
     tuned subset of rules from es-ca).
   * Current POS disambiguator is directly taken from es-ca.
     Note: Orthography is taken from "Academia de l'Aragonés - Estudio de 
     Filolochía Aragonesa", a board created in the II Congreso de l'Aragonés.  
     http://www.academiadelaragones.org/biblio/EDACAR7_2.pdf . 
     It is the orthography used in Wikipedia in Aragonese 
     (http://an.wikipedia.org). 
     There is  partial compatibility in analysis with other previously used 
     orthographies.

 * Initial release (0.1.0)
 * Caveats:
   - Functions only in an->es direction
   - Several closed category words missing from an analyser
     (including "ir")
   - "Cowboys, Ted!"
     This system has been put together in a very shoddy, MacGuyver-ish
     way:
     The majority of the lexicon has been composed on the basis
     of presumed cognates. For the most part, this has been 
     restricted to Latin derivatives, but on more than one occasion, I
     simply went nuts and pulled in anything the Spanish analyser would
     recognise.
     The only bitexts available were the UN Declaration of Human Rights
     and the welcome message for new users of the Aragonese Wikipedia. 
     Statistical methods were not widely employed.
     To deal with the spelling variations, I abused the heck out of sed,
     filtering unknowns repeatedly before passing the result through the
     analyser, to pluck out the results. Much of the ~8000 words in the
     bilingual lexicon are mere variations. (In a particularly ironic
     twist, it has 3 variations of 'normalización'). These variants will 
     need to be sorted out to have es->an: the first translation made with
     this system before release was of the document on an.wikipedia 
     describing the new spelling rules.
     Although I got some notes from Juan Pablo Martínez on the equivalents
     of ser and estar, I was not able to get further information. My  
     "solution" is to ignore the issue and come back to it later.
     Also, Juan Pablo added some vocabulary to the analyser, most of which
     I have not been able to use for lack of translations. Hopefully, we
     can get these reinstated soon.
     A tagger has yet to be trained for Aragonese; during development, I found
     the Spanish tagger to be sufficient, and so have used that. This is a
     temporary measure.
